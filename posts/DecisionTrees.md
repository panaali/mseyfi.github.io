## 🌳 Decision Tree Tutorial

### Part 1: What Is a Decision Tree?

A Decision Tree is a recursive, rule-based model that partitions the feature space $\mathbb{R}^n$ into disjoint regions and assigns a prediction to each region. It works by splitting the dataset at each node based on feature values to reduce some measure of impurity or error.

### Part 2: Splits and Split Criteria

A **split** is a binary partition of your dataset using a feature $x_j$ and a threshold $t$:

* Left Child: $\{x \mid x_j \leq t\}$
* Right Child: $\{x \mid x_j > t\}$

We want to pick the split that results in the most **homogeneous** child nodes (lowest impurity or error).

We use a greedy algorithm to find the best (feature, threshold) pair by minimizing:

$L_{\text{split}} = \frac{n_L}{n} L_L + \frac{n_R}{n} L_R$

Where:

* $L_L, L_R$: loss of the left and right child
* $n_L, n_R$: number of samples in left and right
* $n = n_L + n_R$

### Part 3: Classification Losses

#### Gini Impurity:

$$
G(S) = \sum_{c=1}^{C} p(c) (1 - p(c)) = 1 - \sum_{c=1}^{C} p(c)^2
$$

The Gini impurity measures how often a randomly chosen element from the set would be incorrectly labeled if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset. Kind of the expected value of miss-classification.

The term $p(c)^2$ reflects the probability of **correctly guessing** the label if you sample twice with replacement:

* $p(c)^2$: probability that two independent samples from the node belong to class $c$.
* $\sum p(c)^2$: total probability of correct matches.
* So $1 - \sum p(c)^2$: total probability of **mismatches** → this is the impurity.

The square emphasizes that a node with one dominant class (large $p(c)$) gets much lower Gini, reinforcing purity.

#### Entropy:

$$
H(S) = -\sum_{c=1}^{C} p(c) \log_2 p(c)
$$

Entropy comes from information theory. It measures the **expected number of bits** required to encode a label drawn at random.

* When all classes are equally likely → maximum entropy.
* When one class dominates → entropy is near zero.

By minimizing entropy after a split, we aim to move towards **certainty** (low disorder). This means the region is more "pure", with fewer mixed-class samples.

#### How is $p(c)$ defined?

Given $n$ samples in a node and $n_c$ samples that belong to class $c$:

$$
p(c) = \frac{n_c}{n}
$$

It represents the **empirical probability** of class $c$ in the current node. Since the total number of samples in the node is $n$, we have:

$$
\sum_{c=1}^{C} p(c) = 1
$$

### Part 4: Regression Loss

#### Mean Squared Error (MSE):

$$
L(S) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2 = \text{Var}(S)
$$

* $y_i$ refers to the **true target value** of the $i^{th}$ training sample within the current node.
* $\bar{y}$ is the **mean** of all $y_i$ values in the node (i.e., the prediction the model will output for all samples in this region).
* So this formula measures how far each true value $y_i$ is from the average $\bar{y}$, and **squares** that distance to penalize larger deviations more.

This is the **mean squared error (MSE)**, and it's used to quantify how well a node's prediction (the average) fits the actual values.

---

### Part 5: Greedy Training Strategy

At each node:

1. Loop through every feature.
2. For each unique threshold in that feature:

   * Split the dataset.
   * Compute child losses.
   * Compute $L_{\text{split}}$.
3. Choose the split with **minimum total loss**.

This is greedy: no backtracking or lookahead.

#### Depth-Based Splitting

Let the user specify a maximum depth $D$. Starting from the root (depth 0), recursively split **both child nodes**, regardless of which has higher or lower loss. That is:

* Even if one child has a worse loss than the other, **both children** are grown recursively to the next depth.
* The selection of the split is based on minimizing the total weighted loss of **both children combined**.
* This is a key property: you **do not pick just one child to split**. Once the best split is chosen, **both** the left and right child nodes become candidates for further recursive splitting (unless they hit a stopping condition like max depth or pure node).

This strategy allows the tree to grow into a **full binary tree** of depth $D$ (if data allows), where every node potentially splits into two children, recursively.

#### Pseudocode: Tree Growth with Depth Constraint

```python
function grow_tree(dataset, depth):
    if stopping_condition_met(dataset, depth):
        return Leaf(value = compute_leaf_value(dataset))

    best_feature, best_threshold = find_best_split(dataset)
    left_subset, right_subset = split_dataset(dataset, best_feature, best_threshold)

    left_child = grow_tree(left_subset, depth + 1)
    right_child = grow_tree(right_subset, depth + 1)

    return Node(feature=best_feature, threshold=best_threshold, left=left_child, right=right_child)

function stopping_condition_met(dataset, depth):
    return (depth >= max_depth) or (all_same_class(dataset)) or (dataset too small)
```

This recursive algorithm ensures that once a split is selected, both child nodes are expanded independently — not just the better one.

#### Tree Representation and Inference

Once trained, the decision tree is stored as a nested tree structure of nodes:

* Each node holds the split feature and threshold.
* Each leaf holds a value (class label or regression mean).

**Inference** works by traversing the tree:

1. Start at the root.
2. At each node, check the feature: if $x[f] \leq \text{threshold}$, go to left child; otherwise right.
3. Repeat until a leaf is reached.
4. Return the value in the leaf.

Time complexity of inference is $\mathcal{O}(D)$, where $D$ is the depth of the tree.

### Part 6A: Classification Example

#### Dataset:

| Sample | Weight (g) | Class |
| ------ | ---------- | ----- |
| A      | 150        | 0     |
| B      | 160        | 0     |
| C      | 170        | 0     |
| D      | 180        | 1     |
| E      | 200        | 1     |

#### Depth 0: Root Node

Try split at threshold = 165:

* Left: \[150, 160] → Class = 0 → $G_L = 0$
* Right: \[170, 180, 200] → Classes = \[0, 1, 1] → $p(0) = \frac{1}{3}, p(1) = \frac{2}{3}$ → $G_R = \frac{4}{9}$
* Weighted Gini: $\frac{2}{5} \cdot 0 + \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{4}{9} = \frac{4}{15} \approx 0.266$

#### Depth 1:

**Left child** (\[150, 160]) → Pure → Leaf = 0

**Right child** (\[170, 180, 200])

* Try threshold = 175:

  * Left: \[170] → Class = 0 → $G = 0$
  * Right: \[180, 200] → Class = 1 → $G = 0$
  * Weighted Gini: $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 0 + \frac{2}{3} \cdot 0 = 0$

Perfect split → Both children are pure.

#### Final Tree Table:

| Depth | Node          | Samples | Gini | Split        | Left Child  | Right Child    |
| ----- | ------------- | ------- | ---- | ------------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| 0     | Root          | A–E     | 0.48 | Weight ≤ 165 | A, B        | C, D, E        |
| 1     | Left of root  | A, B    | 0    | —            | Leaf: 0     | —              |
| 1     | Right of root | C, D, E | 0.44 | Weight ≤ 175 | C (Leaf: 0) | D, E (Leaf: 1) |

Tree growth terminates as all leaves are pure or max depth is reached.



### Part 6B: Regression Example

#### Dataset:

| Sample | Size | Price |
| ------ | ---- | ----- |
| A      | 1100 | 200   |
| B      | 1300 | 240   |
| C      | 1500 | 270   |
| D      | 1700 | 310   |
| E      | 1900 | 350   |

#### Root Node (Depth 0):

* Try threshold: Size $\leq 1400$
* Left: A, B → Mean = 220 → MSE = $\frac{(200-220)^2 + (240-220)^2}{2} = 400$
* Right: C, D, E → Mean = 310 → MSE = $\frac{(270-310)^2 + (310-310)^2 + (350-310)^2}{3} = 533.33$
* Weighted MSE = $\frac{2}{5} \cdot 400 + \frac{3}{5} \cdot 533.33 = 480$

#### Depth 1:

* Left child is pure enough or has small data → stop
* Right child: C, D, E

  * Try threshold: Size $\leq 1600$

    * Left: C → Mean = 270, MSE = 0
    * Right: D, E → Mean = 330, MSE = $\frac{(310-330)^2 + (350-330)^2}{2} = 400$
    * Weighted MSE = $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 0 + \frac{2}{3} \cdot 400 = 266.67$

#### Final Tree Table:

| Depth | Node          | Samples | Split       | MSE    | Prediction |
| ----- | ------------- | ------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- |
| 0     | Root          | A–E     | Size ≤ 1400 | 480    |            |
| 1     | Left of Root  | A, B    | —           | 400    | Mean = 220 |
| 1     | Right of Root | C, D, E | Size ≤ 1600 | 266.67 |            |
| 2     | Left          | C       | —           | 0      | Mean = 270 |
| 2     | Right         | D, E    | —           | 400    | Mean = 330 |

### Part 7: Tree Pruning

Decision trees can easily overfit the training data by creating very specific branches for rare patterns. To prevent this, we apply **pruning**, which simplifies the tree structure.

#### Why Prune?

* Reduce overfitting
* Improve generalization
* Shrink model size

#### Types of Pruning

1. **Pre-pruning (early stopping)**

   * This stops tree growth **during training** based on certain conditions:

     * **Max depth**: Stop splitting further once the tree reaches a specified depth.
     * **Min samples per node**: Only allow a split if a node has more than a certain number of samples.
     * **Min impurity decrease**: Stop splitting if the reduction in impurity (e.g. Gini or entropy) is less than a small threshold.
   * Pre-pruning is fast and easy to implement, but can miss optimal splits that occur later in the tree.

2. **Post-pruning (cost-complexity pruning)**

   * The tree is grown **to full depth first** (or nearly full).
   * Then, starting from the leaves, we consider removing splits (i.e., replacing internal nodes with leaves).
   * A split is removed if it does not significantly reduce error on a **validation set**.
   * This process simplifies the tree while ensuring it still performs well.

#### Cost-Complexity Pruning (CCP)

Define an objective function:

$$
R_\alpha(T) = R(T) + \alpha |T|
$$

* $R(T)$: empirical error (e.g. misclassification rate, Gini, entropy) of tree $T$
* $|T|$: number of terminal (leaf) nodes
* $\alpha$: regularization parameter controlling the trade-off between accuracy and simplicity

We prune the tree by selecting subtrees that minimize $R_lpha(T)$. Larger $lpha$ encourages simpler trees. CCP is used in many implementations such as `scikit-learn`’s `DecisionTreeClassifier`.

Decision trees can easily overfit the training data by creating very specific branches for rare patterns. To prevent this, we apply **pruning**, which simplifies the tree structure.

| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Classification | Gini / Entropy | Majority class |
| Regression     | MSE / Variance | Mean value     |
